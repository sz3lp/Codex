# SaaS Scaffold

This repository contains a minimal SaaS scaffold with a Next.js frontend and a FastAPI backend.

- **frontend/** – Next.js application
- **backend/** – FastAPI application

Each directory has its own README with setup instructions.

The frontend includes a sample `/prompt` page demonstrating Tailwind CSS and
client-server interaction.
